## Challenge

Multiple enterprise clients faced similar challenges with their core business systems:

- Legacy CRM implementations with poor adoption and fragmented data
- BI reporting that was manual, slow, and disconnected from operational systems
- Business processes designed around old architectures that no longer served the organization
- Teams reliant on key individuals with no structured knowledge transfer

## Approach

### Discovery & Requirements

Each engagement began with a thorough discovery phase:

- **Business needs analysis** — Acted as Subject Matter Expert to develop system and business requirements
- **Current-state mapping** — Analyzed existing processes, data flows, and system dependencies
- **Stakeholder alignment** — Demonstrated business value to help clients understand the intent behind changes
- **Roadmap development** — Ranked requirements against strategic goals and initiative priorities

### Architecture & Process Redesign

The core of each project was redesigning processes to fit a modern architecture:

- **Shared Service Center model** — Redesigned processes to centralize common functions and reduce duplication
- **Self-service automation** — Identified manual touchpoints that could be automated or made self-service
- **CRM consolidation** — Unified fragmented customer data into a single source of truth
- **BI integration** — Connected operational and analytical systems for real-time reporting and decision support

### Implementation & Delivery

Solutions were delivered using a structured project management approach:

- **Project management** — Managed all tasks and resources throughout the project lifecycle
- **Quality assurance** — Ensured progress and quality aligned with defined expectations
- **Vendor management** — Established and maintained relationships with third-party vendors
- **Efficiency recommendations** — Continuously identified ways to improve quality of existing implementations

### Knowledge Transfer & Training

A hallmark of every engagement was building client capability:

- **Train-the-trainer sessions** — Delivered sessions for customer key users to ensure long-term self-sufficiency
- **Junior consultant mentoring** — Trained and guided junior team members during project execution
- **Functional documentation** — Created comprehensive documentation for handover and future maintenance

## Results

- **10+ projects delivered** successfully across CRM, EBS, and BI domains
- **Processes modernized** around Shared Service Center architecture, eliminating redundant workflows
- **Self-service enabled** — Automation features reduced reliance on manual intervention
- **Team capability built** — Train-the-trainer approach ensured clients could maintain and extend solutions
- **Vendor relationships** managed effectively, ensuring long-term support and evolution

## Key Takeaways

1. **Requirements drive everything** — Investing in discovery prevents costly mid-project pivots.
2. **Process before technology** — Automating a broken process just creates faster chaos. Redesign first.
3. **Build capability, not dependency** — Train-the-trainer ensures the organization can evolve without you.
4. **Standardize across projects** — Common patterns across engagements accelerate delivery and reduce risk.
