## Challenge

The client's QA and Chargeback operations relied heavily on manual processes:

- Spreadsheet-based tracking for quality audits
- Email-driven chargeback workflows with no audit trail
- Inconsistent processes across regional teams
- Limited visibility into performance metrics

## Approach

### Discovery & Process Mining

We started by mapping existing processes to identify bottlenecks and automation opportunities:

- **Process observation** — Shadowed teams to understand actual (vs. documented) workflows
- **Data analysis** — Analyzed ticket volumes, processing times, and error rates
- **Stakeholder interviews** — Gathered pain points and improvement ideas from team leads

Key findings:
- 40% of QA time was spent on data collection and formatting
- Chargeback disputes averaged 12 days to resolve due to manual handoffs
- No standardized quality criteria across regions

### Solution Design

Based on discovery findings, we designed a three-pillar solution:

**1. Automated Data Collection & Reporting**
- Built API integrations to pull data from source systems automatically
- Created standardized quality scorecards with automated population
- Deployed real-time dashboards for team leads and management

**2. Workflow Automation**
- Designed structured workflows for chargeback dispute resolution
- Implemented automatic routing based on dispute type and value
- Added SLA tracking with escalation triggers

**3. Process Standardization**
- Defined common quality criteria and evaluation templates
- Created playbooks for common scenarios
- Established governance for process changes

### Implementation

The solution was built iteratively:

- **Sprint 1-2** — Core data integrations and automated reporting
- **Sprint 3-4** — Chargeback workflow automation
- **Sprint 5-6** — Quality audit standardization and dashboards
- **Sprint 7-8** — Rollout to remaining regions, training, and handover

Technology stack:
- Custom REST APIs for system integration
- Low-code workflow engine for process automation
- Business intelligence platform for reporting
- Shared documentation repository for playbooks

## Results

- **60% reduction** in manual data collection and formatting tasks
- **40% faster** chargeback dispute resolution (12 days to 7 days average)
- **Standardized processes** across all regional teams
- **Real-time dashboards** providing visibility to team leads and executives
- **Improved audit trail** — all actions tracked and reportable

## Lessons Learned

1. **Observe before automating** — Understanding the real process (not just the documented one) is critical.
2. **Quick wins build momentum** — Automated reporting was delivered in the first sprint, generating immediate stakeholder buy-in.
3. **Standardize then automate** — Automating inconsistent processes just creates faster inconsistency.
4. **Train for adoption** — The best automation fails if teams don't understand or trust it.
