## Challenge

The client recognized the potential of AI but faced common blockers:

- No structured approach to evaluating AI opportunities
- Concerns about regulatory compliance (particularly around explainability)
- Data scattered across siloed systems with inconsistent quality
- Teams eager to experiment but lacking a governance framework

## Approach

### Phase 1: Readiness Assessment

We evaluated the organization's AI readiness across five dimensions:

- **Data maturity** — Quality, accessibility, and governance of existing data assets
- **Technical infrastructure** — Compute, storage, and integration capabilities
- **Talent & skills** — Current team capabilities and gaps
- **Governance** — Existing policies for data, model management, and ethics
- **Culture** — Organizational appetite for AI-driven change

### Phase 2: Use Case Discovery

Through structured workshops with business and technology stakeholders, we identified 12 potential AI use cases and scored them on:

- **Business impact** — Revenue, cost, or risk reduction potential
- **Feasibility** — Data availability, technical complexity, time to value
- **Risk** — Regulatory, ethical, and reputational considerations

The top three use cases were selected for implementation:

1. **Automated document classification** for compliance review
2. **Anomaly detection** in transaction monitoring
3. **Customer inquiry routing** using natural language understanding

### Phase 3: Implementation & Governance

Each use case followed a structured implementation pattern:

- Proof of concept with defined success criteria
- Data pipeline design with quality validation
- Model development with explainability requirements
- Human-in-the-loop validation workflow
- Monitoring and feedback loops for continuous improvement

We also established the **AI Governance Framework**:

- Model risk assessment template
- Bias testing and fairness evaluation checklist
- Explainability requirements by use-case risk tier
- Model lifecycle management (training, deployment, monitoring, retirement)

## Results

- **12 use cases** identified and prioritized with a clear implementation roadmap
- **3 AI solutions** deployed within 4 months, each meeting defined success criteria
- **30% reduction** in manual review time for compliance document classification
- **Full regulatory compliance** — all models passed internal audit and regulatory review
- **Reusable framework** — the AI adoption methodology was adopted as an organizational standard

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with governance** — Establishing guardrails early prevents costly rework and builds stakeholder trust.
2. **Prioritize ruthlessly** — Not every use case deserves investment. Focus on high-impact, high-feasibility opportunities.
3. **Explainability is non-negotiable** — In regulated industries, "it just works" isn't enough.
4. **Build for iteration** — AI solutions improve over time. Design for monitoring, feedback, and retraining.
