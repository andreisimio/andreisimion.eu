## Challenge

A global telecom operator needed to scale its service architecture practice while transitioning responsibilities to a new delivery center. Key challenges included:

- Two critical roles needed to be transitioned from Budapest to Bucharest without disruption
- New product development lacked a standardized service design process
- Existing solutions were bespoke with limited reuse across the Unified Communications portfolio
- Service offerings were not consistently aligned with overarching service strategies

## Approach

### Phase 1: Role Transition & Knowledge Transfer

The first priority was ensuring continuity during the transition:

- **Structured knowledge transfer** — Documented all existing processes, contacts, and decision-making frameworks
- **Shadowing period** — New team members worked alongside outgoing staff to absorb tacit knowledge
- **Stakeholder re-mapping** — Rebuilt relationships with network, IT, and business process designers

### Phase 2: Service Design Standardization

With the team in place, we focused on professionalizing the service design practice:

- **End-to-end ownership** — Established clear accountability for New Product Development service design activities
- **Group standards adoption** — Applied and improved group-wide architecture standards across the portfolio
- **Reuse framework** — Created a catalog of reusable service components to avoid reinventing solutions
- **Solution sign-off process** — Defined review gates for solution designs, standards, support models, and cost estimates

### Phase 3: Cross-Functional Leadership

As Lead Solution Designer, I managed a virtual team spanning multiple disciplines:

- **Virtual team leadership** — Coordinated network designers, IT architects, and business process designers
- **Presales integration** — Ensured service offerings and customer propositions aligned with service strategies
- **Training & mentoring** — Delivered cross-organization training for new product releases and onboarded new team members
- **Best practice advocacy** — Served as subject matter expert for service architecture best practices

## Results

- **Seamless role transition** — Two roles fully transitioned with zero impact to ongoing programs
- **Standardized service design** — Consistent design process adopted across the Unified Communications portfolio
- **Improved reuse** — Existing solutions and capabilities cataloged and reused before creating new offerings
- **Faster releases** — Reduced time-to-market through standardized templates and pre-approved components
- **Knowledge multiplier** — Cross-organization training empowered teams to self-serve on routine design tasks

## Key Takeaways

1. **Standardize before you scale** — Without consistent processes, growth only multiplies inconsistency.
2. **Reuse is a discipline** — It requires a catalog, governance, and a culture that rewards using what exists.
3. **Virtual teams need clear ownership** — Cross-functional collaboration requires explicit roles and decision rights.
4. **Invest in people** — Training and mentoring create lasting capability, not just one-time delivery.
