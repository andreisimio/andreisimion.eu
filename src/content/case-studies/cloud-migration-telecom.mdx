## Challenge

The client operated a complex legacy infrastructure supporting millions of customers. Key challenges included:

- Aging on-premise data centers with rising maintenance costs
- Monolithic applications tightly coupled to specific hardware
- Regulatory requirements for data residency and security
- Need to maintain 24/7 service availability during transition

## Approach

### Phase 1: Assessment & Strategy

We began with a comprehensive workload assessment using a structured framework:

- **Application portfolio analysis** — Categorized 200+ applications by migration complexity and business criticality
- **Dependency mapping** — Identified inter-system dependencies that would affect migration sequencing
- **Cost modeling** — Built detailed TCO comparisons for each migration pattern (rehost, replatform, refactor)
- **Risk assessment** — Evaluated regulatory, security, and operational risks

### Phase 2: Foundation & Governance

Before migrating workloads, we established the cloud foundation:

- Landing zone design with multi-account strategy
- Network architecture with hybrid connectivity
- Security controls and compliance guardrails
- Cost management and tagging policies
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for all key decisions

### Phase 3: Migration Execution

Workloads were migrated in waves, ordered by complexity and business impact:

- **Wave 1** — Development and testing environments (low risk, high learning)
- **Wave 2** — Internal tools and batch processing systems
- **Wave 3** — Customer-facing applications with blue-green deployment
- **Wave 4** — Core billing and CRM platforms

Each wave followed a consistent pattern: assess, prepare, migrate, validate, optimize.

## Architecture Decisions

Key architectural patterns adopted:

- **Strangler fig pattern** for decomposing monoliths incrementally
- **Event-driven integration** using Amazon EventBridge for decoupled communication
- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform for repeatable, auditable deployments
- **C4 Model documentation** maintained alongside code in version control

## Results

The migration delivered measurable outcomes:

- **40% cost reduction** through right-sizing and reserved capacity
- **99.95% uptime** maintained throughout the migration process
- **Zero data loss** across all migration waves
- **6-month timeline** from strategy to final wave completion
- **Improved deployment velocity** — releases went from monthly to weekly

## Lessons Learned

1. **Invest in the foundation** — The landing zone and governance work paid for itself in reduced rework.
2. **Sequence matters** — Starting with low-risk workloads built team confidence and refined processes.
3. **Document decisions** — ADRs prevented costly revisits and provided audit trails.
4. **Communicate constantly** — Weekly stakeholder updates maintained trust during a high-risk program.
