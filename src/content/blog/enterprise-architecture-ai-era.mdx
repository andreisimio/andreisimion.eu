The rise of generative AI and large language models has prompted every enterprise architect to ask: _does this change everything?_

The short answer is **no** — but it changes enough to matter.

## What Stays the Same

Enterprise architecture has always been about alignment: ensuring technology decisions serve business goals. That hasn't changed. The core disciplines still apply:

- **Stakeholder management** — AI projects fail when business and IT don't share a vision.
- **Governance** — If anything, AI demands _more_ governance, not less.
- **Modularity** — Well-decomposed systems adapt faster to new capabilities.
- **Documentation** — Architecture decisions need to be traceable, especially when AI introduces probabilistic behavior.

## What Changes

AI introduces new architectural concerns that traditional frameworks don't fully address:

### 1. Data as a First-Class Citizen

AI models are only as good as their data. Enterprise architects must now treat data architecture with the same rigor as application and infrastructure architecture. This means:

- Establishing data quality pipelines
- Defining data governance policies for training data
- Ensuring lineage and traceability

### 2. Non-Deterministic Behavior

Traditional systems produce predictable outputs. AI systems don't. Architecture must account for:

- Output validation and guardrails
- Human-in-the-loop patterns
- Fallback mechanisms when confidence is low

### 3. New Integration Patterns

LLMs and AI services introduce patterns like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), prompt chaining, and embedding-based search. Architects need to understand these patterns to make informed decisions about where AI fits — and where it doesn't.

## A Practical Framework

When evaluating AI adoption within your enterprise architecture, consider these questions:

1. **Does this use case have a clear business outcome?** If not, it's experimentation — which is fine, but treat it differently.
2. **Is the data available, clean, and governed?** Without quality data, AI creates more problems than it solves.
3. **What's the risk tolerance?** Customer-facing AI needs stricter guardrails than internal automation.
4. **Can the team sustain it?** AI isn't deploy-and-forget. Budget for monitoring, retraining, and governance.

## The Architect's Role

Enterprise architects are uniquely positioned to guide AI adoption because they see the full picture: business strategy, technology landscape, data flows, and organizational capability. The key is to remain grounded in principles while being open to new patterns.

Architecture that thinks ahead isn't about predicting the future — it's about building systems flexible enough to adapt when the future arrives.
