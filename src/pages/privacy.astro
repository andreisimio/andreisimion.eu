      <p><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This website (<strong>andreisimion.eu</strong>) is operated by Andrei Simion.
        Your privacy is important. This policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>This is a static website. By default, no personal data is collected, stored, or processed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No cookies</strong> are set by this website (unless analytics are explicitly enabled).</li>
        <li><strong>No tracking pixels</strong> or third-party trackers are embedded.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact form submissions</strong> are sent directly via email or a configured form service, and are not stored on this server.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        If privacy-friendly analytics (such as Plausible Analytics) are enabled, they collect
        aggregate, anonymized data — no personal information, no cookies, and full GDPR compliance.
      </p>

      <h2>External Links</h2>
      <p>
        This site may link to external services (e.g., LinkedIn). These services have their own
        privacy policies and are not controlled by this website.
      </p>

      <h2>Fonts</h2>
      <p>
        This website loads fonts from Google Fonts. When you visit, your browser connects to Google servers.
        Google's privacy policy applies to this data transfer.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Under GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify, or delete any personal data.
        Since this site does not store personal data, these rights are already upheld by default.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
